## AI Algorithm

### General idea

The idea is to run several [negamax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax) searches using [alphaâ€“beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning), each in a different thread.

Thus, the AI runs in two parts:

1) A shallow multithreaded [depth-first search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), in which the AI goes 2 moves deep.

2) A [negamax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax) search at the end of each branch of the initial DFS.

### Compute a board score

As the negamax exploration is run with a limited depth, a way to compute the score of a board is required.

First, a score has to be chosen for each piece:
- 1 point for a man
- 2 points for a king

Then, a coefficient has to be chosen, representing how close is the game to be a draw (either by 3 repetitions, or by playing 2 * 40 moves without capture nor promotion). A coefficient of 50 reduces players' effective score by half. The following functions where chosen (rather arbitrarily):
